		/**The Westfield Carpet Company has asked you to write an application (RoomDemo) that calculates the price of carpeting for rectangular rooms. 
		 * To calculate the price, you multiply the area of the floor (width times length) by the price per square foot of carpet. 
		 * For example, the area of floor that is 12 feet long and 10 feet wide is 120 square feet. 
		 * To cover that floor with carpet that costs $8 per square foot would cost $960. (12 × 10 × 8 = 960.)
First, you should create a class named RoomDimension that has two fields: one for the length of the room and one for the width. 
The RoomDimension class should have a method that returns the area of the room. 
(The area of the room is the room’s length multiplied by the room’s width.)
Next you should create a RoomCarpet class that has a RoomDimension object as a field. 
It should also have a field for the cost of the carpet per square foot. 
The RoomCarpet class should have a method that returns the total cost of the carpet.
Figure 8-21 (Links to an external site.) is a UML diagram that shows possible class designs and the relationships among the classes. 
Once you have written these classes, use them in an application that asks the user to enter the dimensions of a room 
and the price per square foot of the desired carpeting. The application should display the total cost of the carpet.  
UML diagram is on page 555 in book.
